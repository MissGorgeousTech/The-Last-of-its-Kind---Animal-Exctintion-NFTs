# The-Last-of-its-Kind---Animal-Exctintion-NFTs

Because of loss of habitat by climate changes or human activity, lots of different animals species are going extinct. And each one of them has an important role in nature.
I would like to contribute to saving animals in this world, after feeling helplessness when watching the documentaries and the news. And how to do that using tech and the awesome web 3.0? By creating a DAO that will provide a comission on every NFT auction sale for the charities responsible for the protection of the endangered species. These NFTs are unique and put for auction. 
The DAO will have other interesting features as well. You can read about the project in pdf format or powerpoint presentation.
